Dice Challenge

In this challenge the goal is to model a set of dice. Create a `DiceSet` class, each will contain two `Dice` instances (create a class for it too).

Create a `roll` method for `DiceSet` which rolls both dice. Each Dice is 6 sided and should return a random number each time it is rolled. `rand()` can be used to achieve this.

Create another method for `DiceSet` called display which will show values of both dice.

Once both classes work as expected, create a Ruby script and require each class to its `init.rb`.

The script should have introductory text, and a loop which gets user input. The user can type `'r'` to roll again or `q` to quit the script.

**Further notes:**

- Follow best practices for scripts and file organization.
- Use instance variables and attribute methods.
- Use at least one `public` and `private` method.
- Make use of initialize methods.
