# Challenge: Birth Date Analysis 🐣📅

In this challenge, ask the user for the year, month and date of their birth.
Then analyse the data and report it back to the user:

- Day of the week they were born (e.g "Thursday")
- Day of the year they were born as a number (e.g "200th")
- The week of the year as a number (e.g 2)
- Whether it was a leap year or not.

Creating classes is not required, but the script will have at least a `init.rb` file and will make use of `Date` and `Time` classes.
