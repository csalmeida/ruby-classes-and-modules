# Getting Started

This repository follows [Kevin Skoglund's Ruby Classes and Modules course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/ruby-classes-and-modules/learn-to-use-custom-classes-in-ruby) and makes use of concepts mentioned on the [Ruby Fundamentals]() repo.

To get started Ruby needs to be installed on the machine:
```
ruby -v 
```

Should return something similar to:
`ruby 2.3.7p456 (2018-03-28 revision 63024) [universal.x86_64-darwin18]`

> If the `ruby` command is not found, [install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).

# Introduction

Ruby is an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) language and custom classes and modules can be defined to improve how code is organized with the aim to make it easier to maintain and add new features.

Classes provide templates for creating objects or instances of a class that have unique attributes and behaviour and can interact with eachother in complex ways.

# Classes

The important concept of OOP is likely to be classes. This section will look at defining custom classes.

A class defines code grouped by a common theme or purpose that provides a template of the state and behavior of objects created from it.

Objects that exist in Ruby have classes as well such as 'Integer', 'String', 'Symbol', the 'NilClass' and many more.

Ruby can be asked what class an object belongs to by using the `class` method:

```ruby
# classes/define-class.rb
word = 'Ruby'
word.class # String

[1..5].class # Array
```

There are built-in Ruby classes, however custom ones can be defined.

## Define a class

Classes are defined in a block wrapped by the `class` keyword, followed by the name of the class, and `end`.

```ruby
# classes/define-class.rb
class ShoppingCart
  #...
end
```

Classes are typically defined within the following guidelines:

- Named using singular nouns.
- Capitalized and camel cased names. (e.g, "ShoppingCart")
- Define each class in a separate file
- Grouped class files in a directory

Classes can be redefined and modified without error which is not common is most programming languages.

Classes can have _attributes_ which hold the current state of an object and _methods_ which define behavior of the object, similar to [custom methods](https://github.com/csalmeida/ruby-fundamentals#define-and-call-methods).

Additionally, [the Ruby path](https://github.com/csalmeida/ruby-fundamentals#best-practices) does not need to be added to class files, only to the main script file:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
```
