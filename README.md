# Getting Started

This repository follows [Kevin Skoglund's Ruby Classes and Modules course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/ruby-classes-and-modules/learn-to-use-custom-classes-in-ruby) and makes use of concepts mentioned on the [Ruby Fundamentals]() repo.

To get started Ruby needs to be installed on the machine:
```
ruby -v 
```

Should return something similar to:
`ruby 2.3.7p456 (2018-03-28 revision 63024) [universal.x86_64-darwin18]`

> If the `ruby` command is not found, [install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).

# Introduction

Ruby is an object oriented programming language and custom classes and modules can be defined to improve how code is organized with the aim to make it easier to maintain and add new features.

Classes provide templates for creating objects or instances of a class that have unique attributes and behaviour and can interact with eachother in complex ways.
